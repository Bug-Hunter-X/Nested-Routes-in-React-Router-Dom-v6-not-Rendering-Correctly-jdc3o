# React Router Dom v6 Nested Routes Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using nested routes in React Router Dom v6.  Nested routes are defined, but they are not always being matched and rendered correctly. This appears to be an intermittent issue, making it difficult to debug.

## Bug Description

Nested routes within the React Router v6 setup fail to render consistently. The expected behavior is that nested routes should be rendered based on the URL path; however, this is not always the case. The issue seems to be random; sometimes the nested routes work, and other times, they do not.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the application: `npm start`
4. Observe that navigation to nested routes might not consistently render the correct components.

## Solution

The solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`.  It addresses the issue by [insert brief description of the solution here, e.g., ensuring correct path definitions and component structure].
